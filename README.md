# 🌐👋 - Hello World  

Root is a company built by developers for developers. Open Source Software is part of our culture. We open-source as much of our codebase as we can.

Our SDKs are community maintained. (because we’re not experts in go, or lolcode, or ruby, or swift or rust or any of the plethora of wonderful languages living out in the wild).

This repo for the .NET Insurance SDK is currently just a placeholder, but you can change that.

For help and support, please reach out to us on the Root Club Slack.
